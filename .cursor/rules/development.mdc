# Development Notes

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- `app/client/` - Client-side React components
- `app/common/` - Shared utilities and types
- `app/server/` - Server-side code

## Code Organization

- Place new code in appropriate directories:
  - `app/client/` - Client-side React components
  - `app/common/` - Shared utilities and types
  - `app/server/` - Server-side code
  - etc.
- When making a new export directory, update package.json with it.

## Building

- `yarn build` - Production build
- `yarn build-test` - Build and run tests, used in git build runner
- `yarn build-git-add` - Build and stage dist files. Handy shortcut.
- `yarn clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `yarn reinstall` - Full dependency reinstall

## Testing

- Vitest tests should be written alongside new code
- Test files should be co-located next to their source files

- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn test:coverage` - Coverage test
